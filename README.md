# 4th-Project-Passenger-Counter
A Passenger counter webpage using Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS.
This was my first JS project. It's used to count the number of people who have entered the train.

## Screenshots
### How it looks

The app itself is very simple. It has an increment, decrement, reset, and save button.
